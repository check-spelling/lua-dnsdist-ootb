# What is this?

Utility to configure [dnsdist](https://dnsdist.org/) in a quick way.
The configuration is composed of the following parts:
- `services`: DNS services to start (DNS, DoH, DoT)
- `admin`: Enables the console, web API and more
- `rules`: Defines how to handle your DNS traffic

See the complete **[configuration](./examples/0.dnsdist.conf)** file for all options.

## Installation

1. Copy `dnsdist_utils.lua` and the folder `dnsdist_utils` in your `dnsdist` configuration folder (the default is `/etc/dnsdist`)
4. Add the following code to your `dnsdist.conf` to import this LUA module

```lua
-- Import module
package.path = "/etc/dnsdist/" .. package.path
dnsdist_utils = require "dnsdist_utils"
```
## Get started

Below a quick configuration to start dnsdist like a `Forwarding and Caching DNS Server` to a pool of DNS public servers.

```lua
-- Import module
package.path = "/etc/dnsdist/" .. package.path
dnsdist_utils = require "dnsdist_utils"

-- Basic Forwarding and Caching DNS Server to a pool of public DNS servers
opts = {
    rules = {
        -- rule #1: load balancing of the outgoing traffic to a pool 
        -- of dns servers in round robin 
        { 
            upstreams = { 
                dns={ 
                    {ip="8.8.8.8"}, 
                    {ip="9.9.9.9"},

                }
            } 
        },
    }
}

-- Generate dnsdist config
dnsdist_utils.runServer{opts=opts}
```
